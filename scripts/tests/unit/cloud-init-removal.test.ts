/**
 * Cloud-Init removal guard.
 *
 * This suite exists to fail if anyone reintroduces a Cloud-Init dependency into
 * guest management. The checks are deliberately textual and file-scoped: the
 * requirement is about which Proxmox keys and commands the codebase may write,
 * and a behavioural test cannot observe a `qm set --ipconfig0` that never runs
 * in the test environment.
 *
 * Read-only legacy uses are listed explicitly, so removing a real write is a
 * test failure and adding a new read is a deliberate edit rather than an accident.
