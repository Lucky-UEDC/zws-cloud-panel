/**
 * Node guest-capability diagnostics.
 *
 * A compute node is not "connected" because its API answered. It is ready to
 * carry guest automation only if the QEMU guest-agent channel works and
 * `guest-exec` returns a pid that can be polled to an exit code.
 *
 * Three things this deliberately does not do:
 *
 * - It does not install host software. The guest agent belongs inside the VM
 *   images, not on the hypervisor; the node only has to expose the channel.
 * - It does not report a capability as supported because of a version number or
 *   a flag. A capability is `pass` only when a real call returned a real answer,
 *   and `skip` is never treated as `pass`.
 * - It does not mark a node Ready on API connectivity alone. Connectivity with
 *   no working guest channel would let us create VMs we then cannot configure,
 *   which is the exact failure this whole change exists to remove.
 *
 * Results are cached in `node_guest_capabilities` because the diagnostics are
 * read on every node list render and must not hammer the Proxmox API.
